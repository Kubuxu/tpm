#### Filecoin Foundation 
* There are no outstanding security issues or concerns. 
* Two FIPs are currently in Last Call status, and are scheduled for inclusion in the OhSnap upgrade:

    * Both of these FIPs will be in 'Last Call' status until Monday, January 24
* Two housekeeping items: 
    * We've recently changed the format of the Core Devs call, and implementers are welcome to DM Kaitlin (@kaitlin_FF) with feedback. 
    * We are interested in rescheduling the Core Devs call to better accommodate contributers in Asia/Oceania timezones. Click [HERE](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CSC2632KB/p1642624688011300) to review scheduling preferences and vote for your preference. 

### Planning for the v15 'OhSnap' Network Upgrade 
* Details for and discussion of OhSnap upgrade can be found [HERE](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74#discussioncomment-1922550). 
* Snap Deals
    * Sepcs-actors candidate for v15 was released on Monday, January 10; testing is ongoing, but no consensus -critical changes are expected. 
* Trust Setup has begun.
    * Everything is looking good! Early testing has begun in Asia, and the team expects to conclude setup on January 26. 

### Planning for v16 and the Filecoin Virtual Machine
* Two FIPs will be submitted: one for the FVM, and the second for network fee rebalancing. 
    * The first FIP will be submitted by end of January; timing for the second FIP depends on outputs from canary testing. 
* The FVM development team estimates that implementation teams will need to do very little work to integrate the runtime, and that the FVM will make future network upgrades easier overall. 
* The v16 network timeline depends on testnet requirements, and will be discussed in future meetings as well.
* Kaitlin will bring a list of potential FIPs that could also be implemented during v16.

### Miscellaneous
* The Public Roadmap will be released soon! The submission period was extended through this week, and the release of the final roadmap is scheduled for the end of January.
